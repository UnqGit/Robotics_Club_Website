# Technology:  

## Languages:  
- **HTML:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Used for startup of the main project via &lt;script/&gt; tag running the JavaScript program.
- **CSS:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Used for efficient, responsive and portable rendering of the website.
- **JavaScript:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Used as the main language for the interface with all libraries and frameworks.

## Tools used:  
- **Vite:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Next-generation front-end build tool to dramatically speeds up web development.
- **Git:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Open-source version control system to make working on a group project more convenient.
- **Visual Studio Code:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A light-weight modern IDE and text editor for scalable work environment.
- **SVG:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A vector based XML image that can be scaled infinitely without losing any quality, used for icons.

## Frameworks and libararies:
- **React:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A versatile library for modular and scalable front-end development, which is easy to use and deploy.
- **Motion (previously Framer Motion):**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightweight animation library which is built specifically for React, directly deployable and used in mainstream development.

## What's it about (features):  
A fully human developed professional front-end complete 8 page static responsive website.  
Using modsularised system via objects and React.js utilising the language features(JavaScript) such as map() : filter() and for_each().  
Using svg (a vector based icon images for resizing icons without losing any quality).
Used framer motion for fast and light-weight motions and animations.

# Future scalability:
Making a `contentData` object to make developing a card of information such as `projects` and `team members` which contains
data {type, icon, title, style, description, information} required for easier card generation.  
Making different react documents for each page made in the website, which is easily integratable by just adding a file with the extension `.jsx` in the `pages` directory.
